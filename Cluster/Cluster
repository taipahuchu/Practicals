To process the learning data, the K-means algorithm in data mining starts with a first group of randomly selected centroids, 
which are used as the beginning points for every cluster, and then performs iterative (repetitive) calculations to optimize
the positions of the centroids

It halts creating and optimizing clusters when either:
The centroids have stabilized â€” there is no change in their values because the clustering has been successful.
The defined number of iterations has been achieved.

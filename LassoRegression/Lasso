Lasso regresion to predict the Make of a car
PROC GLMSELECT enables you to partition your data into disjoint subsets for training validation and testing roles. 
This partitioning can be done by using random proportions of the data, or you can designate a variable in your data
set that defines which observations to use for each role. See the section PARTITION Statement for more details.

The following statements randomly partition the baseball data set, using 50% for training, 30% for validation, 
and 20% for testing. The model selected at each step is scored on the validation data, and the average residual
sums of squares (ASE) is evaluated. The model yielding the lowest ASE on the validation data is selected. 
The ASE on the test data is also evaluated, but these data play no role in the selection process. 
Note that a seed for the pseudo-random number generator is specified in the PROC GLMSELECT statement

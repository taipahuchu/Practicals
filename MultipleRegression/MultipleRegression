After adjusting for potential confounding factors (list them), the odds of having nicotine dependence were more than two times higher
for participants with major depression than for participants without major depression (OR=2.36, 95% CI = 1.44-3.81, p=.0001). 
Age was also significantly associated with nicotine dependence, such that older older participants were significantly less likely to have
nicotine dependence (OR= 0.81, 95% CI=0.40-0.93, p=.041).
